# Malware-detection-using-Deep-learning
The project is based on detecting whether the file contains malware or not. In the project, I try to make fast and better than the previous techniques using deep learning and some encoding technique.
Malware detection through standard, signature based methods is getting more and more difficult since all current
malware applications tend to have multiple polymorphic layers to avoid detection or to use side mechanisms to
automatically update themselves to a newer version at short periods of time in order to avoid detection by any
antivirus software.

# Dataset 
The Dataset we use is available here https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04637 in json format. We have taken and convert the part we need into .csv which you can download from the repository. The .csv file contain files encoded in "SHA256" and "MD5" with the label 1 or 0 whic tell whether they are malicious or not.
# Steps to follow:-
1. Converting Excel SHA256 and MD5 to binary format image - Pandas library to import the excel file and then converting it to binary image using the code
                                                               provide in code section. SHA256 and MD5 both use hexa-decimal number system for encoding, we convert
                                                               hexa-decimal system to binary and form image of 24X16 using both SHA256 and MD5.

2. Using CNN architecture to classify the images  - Image are imported and labelled 0 for uneffected (File image without the virus) and 1 for effected (file image with
                                                    virus). The architecture we use is given below : here we use Two path CNN shown in fig 3 the first path is used to
                                                    find relation between pixel image at local level and second path is used to find the image in the new big area of the
                                                    image.
